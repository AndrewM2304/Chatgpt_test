# Tic Tac Toe

## Deploy to GitHub Pages (GitHub Actions)

1. Create a GitHub repository and push this project.
2. In GitHub, open **Settings → Pages** and set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
3. Merge or push to `main`/`master`. The **Deploy to GitHub Pages** workflow builds the site and publishes it.
4. Wait for the Pages URL to appear, then open it to test the game.

## Manual deploy (optional)

```bash
npm install
npm run deploy
```
